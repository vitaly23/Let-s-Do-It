Project Overview Summary:
In this current project we decided to create a platform in the form of a web service to help
people who workout during the Covid-19 pandemic to find co-trainers to workout with in their
selected field of sports, create and join a meeting. By choosing the location and type of
sport. All the available meetings are displayed on a digital map with digital twins that makes
the search of a meeting to join simple, since the map will be displayed to the users sorted by
location on the website’s map, then they will be able to join the meeting.

Purpose of System:
● Find and join user created meetings with the same interest of type of sport
● Create own workout meetings

Scope of System:
The scope of this project is a client-server system that enables users to create or
join meetings of the same type of interest of sport based on their location and a
radius of choice.
Choosing a type of sport will update a map with all the relevant meetings and users.
Advertising of products, security, inventory control, and account billing are not part
of this project.
